    "### Running times\n",
    "The subroutine swapList ha a running time (RT) of order O(n) for an input (a, l, n), because there's a for loop which is executed exactly floor(n/2) times and has constant running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "splitSwap's running time is O(n logn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof.\n",
    "This is shown by defining its RT as a function depending on inputs l and n (a priori), let's say T(l,n). For n<=1, T(l,1)=O(1) because only two lines of constant RT are executed (condition check and return); instead, for n>1, T(l,n)=T(l,n/2)+T(l+n/2,n/2)+O(n). Notice that beginning with a fixed n, T(l,n) can be expanded through this formula, dividing n for 2 each time: this always brings to an expression in terms of the base case T('something',1), so that l is not a variable of this function T.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have this recursive function T(n) defined by: T(1)=O(1), T(n)=2T(n/2)+O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "T(2^k) = 2T(2^(k-1))+2O(2^(k-1))+O(2^k)=\n",
    "\n",
    "       = 2^2 T(2^(k-2))+2^2 O(2^(k-2)) + 2 O(2^(k-1)) + O(2^k) = 2^2 T(2^(k-2)) + 3 O(2^k) =...\n",
    "       \n",
    "       = 2^k T(1) + (2*k+1)O(2^k) = O(2^k) + O(k 2^k) = O(k 2^k)\n",
    "       \n",
    "from which we conclude\n",
    "\n",
    "T(n) = O(n logn).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does splitSwap do?\n",
    "This function applied to the inputs (a, 0, len(a)) swaps the elements of a by cutting a recursively in halves. Before the recursive calls are closed, these sublists of a are swapped by swapList in this way: elements before a pivot-element with index l are exchanged with those after without changing their order, but the way this is done -after the recursive calls- changes the entire order so that, at the end, a is exactly the original one read right-to-left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is this algorithm optimal?\n",
    "No, it's not, because of the recursive calls. In fact, the order can be decreased to O(n) in a simple way, as shown below."
